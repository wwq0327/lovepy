</p>
What does “Django” mean, and how do you pronounce it?
</p>
</p>
Django is named after Django Reinhardt, a gypsy jazz guitarist from the 1930s to early 1950s. To this day, he’s considered one of the best guitarists of all time.
</p>

Django is pronounced <em>JANG-oh. Rhymes with FANG-oh</em>. The “D” is silent.We’ve also recorded an audio clip of the pronunciation.

</p>
</p>
Yes. World Online has been using <em>Django</em> for more than three years. Sites built on Django have weathered traffic spikes of over one million hits an hour and a number of Slashdottings. Yes, it’s quite stable.
</p>
</p>
Does Django scale?
</p>
</p>
Yes. Compared to development time, hardware is cheap, and so Django is designed to take advantage of as much hardware as you can throw at it.
</p>
</p>
Django uses a “shared-nothing” architecture, which means you can add hardware at any level – <em>database</em> servers, caching servers or Web/application servers.
</p>
</p>
The framework cleanly separates components such as its database layer and application layer. And it ships with a simple-yet-powerful cache <em>framework</em>.
