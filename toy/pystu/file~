Yes. World Online has been using *Django* for more than three years. Sites built on Django have weathered traffic spikes of over one million hits an hour and a number of Slashdottings. Yes, it’s quite stable.

Does Django scale?

Yes. Compared to development time, hardware is cheap, and so Django is designed to take advantage of as much hardware as you can throw at it.

Django uses a “shared-nothing” architecture, which means you can add hardware at any level – *database* servers, caching servers or Web/application servers.

The framework cleanly separates components such as its database layer and application layer. And it ships with a simple-yet-powerful cache *framework*.
